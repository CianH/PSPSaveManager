#PSP Save Manager
This is, as the name would suggest, a save manager for PSP save files. 
It automatically scans connected drives and MTP devices to find the right save directories 
Right now it allows you to copy, overwrite and delete saves directly between PPSSPP save folders and real PSP memory cards 
connected as a Windows removable drive and MTP
